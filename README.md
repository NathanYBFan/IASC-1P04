Welcome to the website for my Twine Game, created for the course IASC 1P04 at Brock University!

The Abyss Stares Back is a short lovecraftian game where players encounter then explore an abandoned submaarine. As more information is collected, puzzle pieces slowly start to fit together and slowly you realize the fate that awaits. Heavily inspired by Lovecraftian stories and the SCP foundation - SCP-3000.
